# Voice-Controlled-Smart-Dustbin
The following project is based on AIot (Artificial Intelligence of Things), which uses voice commands to operate the dustbin through bluetooth connection.
Our design is a prototype of the  Speech Controlled Automation System (SCAS).  
The idea is to create a robot which is driven by voice commands.In this design, an android application with a micro controller is used for the controlling the dustbinâ€™s movement.The connection between the application and the robot is facilitated with Bluetooth communication. The commands issued will be relayed over through the channel and will be received by the module. 
The hardware part consists of the mechanical design of the robot, the adequate choice of the motors, and the electronic devices to properly drive the robot joints. The software part contains  the control algorithms that ultimately make the robot move according to the specifications.
