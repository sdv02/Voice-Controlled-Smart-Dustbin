# Voice-Controlled-Smart-Dustbin
The following project is based on AIot (Artificial Intelligence of Things), which uses voice commands to operate the dustbin through bluetooth connection.
Our design is a prototype of the  Speech Controlled Automation System (SCAS).  
The idea is to create a robot which is driven by voice commands.In this design, an android application with a micro controller is used for the controlling the dustbinâ€™s movement.The connection between the application and the robot is facilitated with Bluetooth communication. The commands issued will be relayed over through the channel and will be received by the module.
